## Dear internship applicant,
The scope of this assignment is to see how much internship applicants know about the technologies that Dreamplan uses.
This project is a standard React/Tailwind/NextJs/Typescript template similar to Dreamplan's current website frontend project.
You will have four hours for the assignment, and you will submit it by making a pull request with a description of the features you have developed.

### Intro
Start by downloading the project in visual studio code and create a branch that includes your name. Then select "create a fork" which points to dreamplan-io
/datamatiker-intern-assignment, now the project should be ready for you to get started. Remember to "npm install" before you start developing.  

Now go to figma, here you will find the design you need to develop. Currently, all design for Dreamplan's developers is done in figma.
Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/gKl0SZkthgwqR8434FL5fL/Intern-Assignment---Dat?node-id=0%3A1

You can double click on the different elements of the design and see all the data like. text size, colors, width etc. by selecting "inspect" on the right side.  

You need to develop the pages so they are responsive in mobile, tablet and desktop view with tailwindCSS.
A good advice is to develop mobile first and to start by looking in the tailwind.config file, where we have already put some pre-defined styles.


### 1. Develop the page Q&A 
You need to develop the "Q&A" page which you can find by going to the figma link above. 
Start by creating a page under "src/pages" and try your hand at developing pages preferably with components that will be reused to keep your code dry.

### 2. Develop Page Overview 
You should develop the page "Overview" which you can find by going to the figma link above. 
Start by creating a page under "src/pages" and try your hand at developing the pages, preferably with components that will be reused to keep your code dry.

### 3. Header
You should develop a header that is consistent on both pages. It should be possible to navigate between the pages when pressing "Q&A" and "Overview" in the header. 

### 4. Footer (Extra opg.)
You should develop a footer that is continuous on both pages. It should be possible to tap on the social media icons and be directed to Dreamplan's SoMe (facebook.com/dreamplan).
